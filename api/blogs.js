        description: 'At the heart of Grace Life Foundation’s “Feed A Soul” pillar lies our foundational mission: “Feeding People.” This commitment extends to every corner of our community, however, accessing essential resources such as food can still be an uphill battle for many people. That’s why, instead of asking everyone to come and donate food hampers to us, our GLF Greenhouse program takes the initiative, bringing food directly into the heart of the community whilst equipping beneficiaries with agri-skills that can be transferred or utilised in other communities.',
        description2: "This week, we visited Rugare Orphan Care equipped with food essentials for those in need. We used this as an opportunity to check in with the community and also see how the erected green house has been faring.",

        description3Image: blogTitle1,
        description3: "Through this initiative, we are establishing partnerships with local communities to construct, cultivate, and manage greenhouses. This endeavor serves as a means of knowledge transfer, as we provide training to local residents. As GLF, we take charge of marketing the greenhouse products on behalf of the community and offer additional solutions to alleviate any other challenges they may face. Our primary focus is currently centered on fostering sustainable transformation in the lives of these communities by delivering training and promoting the adoption of Climate Smart Agricultural technologies and innovations. Our overarching objective is to empower these communities to achieve self-reliance and contribute to the overall development of their regions. As part of our immediate relief efforts, we are also extending support to families facing hardships by providing them with well-balanced meals. ",

        description4: "Though still in it’s infancy, Rugare Orphan Care greenhouse product is now highly sort out in the community. Revenue has been utilized, with the consult of GLF, to purchase not only food items, but also sanitation products, school stationary, clothing and a plethora of other items that ensure the smooth running of the orphanage. Furthermore, over 15 individuals have contributed their time and effort into tilling, planting, harvesting and selling the products.These individuals have been fully trained and are well equipped to not only transfer the skills they have learnt to other members looking to get involved, but now also have a knowledge base that makes them more employable, or, start their own independent projects in the future.",
        description5Heading: "What’s Next for GLF Green Houses? ",
        description5: "We hope in the near future to engage with more communities across Zimbabwe and erect more green houses across the nation. We see this as a first step toward ensuring food security within the nation whilst also providing sustainable solutions for those in need. Involvement is never limited but always encouraged!",

The prevalent types of cancers in the country included those affecting the cervix, breast, and prostate.',
        description2: 'Fast forward to 2023, recent statistics from the World Health Organisation (WHO) continue to paint a concerning picture for Zimbabwe. The country has now solidified its place among the top five nations with a distressingly high incidence of cervical cancer, with a startling statistic of 61 out of every 100,000 women being diagnosed annually.',
        description3: 'Cancer is an indiscriminate adversary, affecting individuals from all walks of life. Its causes are multifaceted, ranging from unhealthy lifestyle choices such as excessive alcohol consumption and smoking, to factors like HIV and AIDS, other infections, and an aging population. Early diagnosis emerges as a crucial factor in tipping the scales towards a successful treatment outcome.',
        description4: 'A pivotal aspect of achieving early detection is raising awareness among the population, promoting regular screening, and encouraging swift diagnosis. The significance of screening cannot be overstated—it not only saves lives and improves the quality of life but also substantially reduces the need for and cost of treatments required at advanced stages of the disease.',
        description5: 'However, despite the evident benefits of early detection, Zimbabwe faces formidable challenges in its battle against cancer. Resource constraints, limitations in infrastructure and manpower, and delays in treatment collectively contribute to the high mortality rate in the country. It is imperative to recognize the urgent need for enhanced collaboration between the government and civil society organizations.',
        description6: 'The key lies in fostering more community-based awareness programs on cancer and amplifying outreach screening initiatives for early detection and treatment. By doing so, Zimbabwe can address the existing gaps, bridging the divide between those in need and the life-saving interventions that can make a substantial difference. The synergy of governmental and non-governmental entities is essential in implementing effective strategies to combat the scourge of cancer, ultimately leading to a healthier and more resilient nation.',

        screens: blogImg2,
        description: "In response to the alarming cholera outbreak, the Zimbabwean government has implemented stringent measures, drawing both support and criticism. The decision to ban vendors from selling their goods in major cities' central business districts (CBDs) is a pivotal component of the broader strategy to combat the waterborne disease, as highlighted by Information Minister Jenfan Muswere.",
        description2: "Muswere outlined the comprehensive approach taken by the government, encompassing the removal of vendors from the streets, the destruction of raw sewer-using gardens, the provision of clean water, and the deployment of mobile toilets in city centers. The activation of the Civil Protection Act is a pivotal step in the fight against cholera.",
        description3: "Mitigatory steps include the prohibition of street food vending and cooking in Harare and Chitungwiza, the facilitation of bulk safe water transportation to the western suburbs of Harare to ensure access to safe drinking water, extensive health education campaigns, the elimination of dumpsites in Harare and Chitungwiza, and the reopening of public toilets.",
        description4: "Additionally, Muswere announced a financial commitment from the Treasury, with US$700,000 allocated to clear waste dumpsites in Harare. As per the Ministry of Health and Child Care, Zimbabwe has witnessed a surge in cholera cases, surpassing 7,000, with at least 142 reported deaths. The government's decision to ban vendors from operating in major cities has evoked a range of reactions, particularly from informal traders heavily reliant on vending for their livelihoods. The economic implications of the ban have sparked concerns among vendors, who argue that the outbreak extends beyond urban areas to affect even rural regions without vendors.",
        description5: "Samuel Wadzai, the director of the Vendors Initiative for Social and Economic Transformation, has encouraged his members to adhere to the government's directives. Recognizing the severity of the situation, Wadzai stressed the need for compliance with upcoming regulations. Dismissing the notion that vendors are solely responsible for cholera spread, he called for a comprehensive educational approach to address the multifaceted aspects of the issue.",
        description6: "The government's proactive stance in curbing cholera is met with a complex landscape of economic worries and health considerations, prompting a nuanced conversation on the role of vendors in disease transmission and the need for inclusive solutions to combat the outbreak.",

        description: 'A recent workshop on drug policy and harm reduction in the capital has shed light on a concerning trend: over 60% of admissions to mental health institutions can be directly linked to drug and illegal substance abuse. The revelations, discussed during the workshop, have sparked a call for a reevaluation of existing laws against drug abuse to address the issue more effectively.',
        description2: "Wilson Box, the director of Zimbabwe Civil Liberties and Drug Networks, emphasized the need for a revamped legal framework that prioritizes inclusivity and embraces an effective drug policy rooted in human rights. According to Box, the current laws take a punitive approach to drug users, hindering progress in combating substance abuse.",
        description3: "In advocating for change, Daniel Molokele, the chairperson of the parliamentary portfolio committee on health and child care, urged fellow parliamentarians to champion progressive legislation. He stressed the importance of exploring alternative strategies to tackle the growing menace of drug and substance abuse.",
        description4: "The alarming correlation between mental health cases and substance abuse underscores the urgency of adopting a more holistic and compassionate approach. As the dialogue on drug policy reform gains momentum, there is a collective call for legislation that not only addresses the punitive aspects but also prioritizes the well-being and rights of individuals struggling with addiction. The recognition of the interconnectedness of mental health and substance abuse challenges us to forge a path forward that promotes healing, understanding, and effective intervention strategies.",

        slug: 'child-mariages-in-zimbabwe-a-thorn-in-the-flesh',
        screens: blogImg4,
        description: 'In March 2022, Zimbabwe passed the long awaited Marriage Bill, which outlaws child marriages in the country, a development that was widely applauded as a victory. However, child marriages remain predominant in Zimbabwe despite all the statutory instruments in Zimbabwe that shun child marriages',
        description2: "According to Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (Zimstat), 33.7% of girls under the age of 18 are married, while 2% of boys get married before reaching the age of 18. Child marriage in Zimbabwe is a complex and multifarious issue that stems from the structural, economic and religious factors, thus many factors interact to place a girl at risk of marriage. These factors include but not limited to poverty, social norms that that regard girls and women as the inferior to their male counterparts, religious practices that condone child marriages and the lack of harmonisation among the statutory instruments with regards to the definition of a child.",
        description3: "One can note that the Zimbabwean Constitution defines ‘a child’ as anyone below the age of 18 years of Age. The Children’s Act, Chapter 5:06 define ‘a child’ as anyone below the age of 16 years of age. ‘A minor’ in the same Act is defined as anyone below the age of 18 years. When dealing with the crime of having sex with ‘a young person’, the Criminal Law and Codification Act defines ‘a young person’ as anyone who is below the age of 16. These inconsistencies between these various laws which existed even before the [2013] Constitution continue to exist and its making it difficult for law enforcements agents to deal with child marriage cases especially those that involve girls of 16 and 17 years.",
        description4: "Population Council (2009) puts across that child marriage predominantly affects girls who live in poverty and in rural areas. Girls from the poorest of the households were more than 4 times as likely to be married before age 18 than girls from the richest of the households. Experiences in most African countries shows that there is a strong nexus between socio-economic status and vulnerability as the poorest are those who are also most likely to be out of school, married, and/or forced into non-marital sexual relations.",
        description5: "Religion is also a driver of child marriage in Zimbabwe. For instance, in the apostolic faith, religion combines with traditional culture, and girls are often encouraged to marry much older men at a very young age and religion is a powerful organizing force in Zimbabwe. Studies have shown how religious ideologies have been used to justify abuse of women and children.",
        description6: "Child marriage directly impends the health and well-being of girls such as complications from pregnancy and childbirth as the main cause of death among adolescent girls aged 15-19 in developing countries. Child marriage often ends a girl’s education forever. Girls who marry young are often expected to take on responsibilities and roles at home that are prioritized over attending school. A lack of education limits girls’ choices and opportunities throughout their lives. Married girls and young women between the ages of 15 and 19 with low levels of education are at a much greater risk of domestic and sexual violence from their spouses than older and more educated women. Research has shown spousal age difference, typical of child marriage, as a significant risk factor associated with violence and sexual abuse against girls.",
        description7: "Therefore, there is need for concerted efforts between government and developmental organisations to empower girls and women so as to curb child marriages and empowerment for girls usually comes in the form of ensuring girls are supported with their educational requirements and are retained in school. There is need to positively change the perception of the role of girls and women in society through continuous awareness raising focusing on gender equity and equality. Government should expedite the harmonisation of legal instruments that define children in Zimbabwe as that inconsistency usually makes it difficult to bring perpetrators of child marriages to book. There is also that need to continue conscientizing the Apostolic sects in Zimbabwe about the dangers of child marriages and to enforce the law accordingly when child marriages are reported among this sect regardless of status.",
